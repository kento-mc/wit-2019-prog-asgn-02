Brief description of the game developed:

I built an archery game in which the player has to account for wind speed and direction, and accurately power their shot attempts.
Each shot is scored based on where the arrow lands and the scores are totaled at the end of each round. Each round sets the targets
further back from the player's POV, making higher scores more difficult to achieve. The player determines the number of shots per
round and how many rounds to play.


Justification of spec:

-I used six user-defined classes, adhering to encapsulation rules, complete with all relevant components.
-The main game class contains the draw() and setup() methods. This class makes extensive calls to user-defined classes in an appropriate manner.
-I used many if statements loops.
-I used a number of primitive arrays of type float and int.
-I used two object arrays of type Arrow, one of my user-defined classes.


Known bugs/problems:

I'm not aware of any game-breaking bugs in the final version. There were a few problems I wasn't able to fully solve, or get to a point of refinement
that I was satisfied with.
